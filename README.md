# Project Overview
## Key Question [unfinished]
How can we utilize AWS services to provide a robust data exploration and ML pipeline that predicts the likelihood of advertisements being clicked?

## Topic
In online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding.

## Dataset
Our data is from a kaggle competition, which is provided by Avazu, a service provider of online advertising and digital marketing with its focus on globalized PC and mobile internet advertising. We have 10 days of click-through data containing 6 GB total and one day of ads for testing model predictions.
